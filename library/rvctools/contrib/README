The Machine Vision Toolbox (MVTB) for MATLAB can make use of a number of pieces
of open-source software.

Snapshots of those packages are included in this directory.  Note that these
are provided under there own licence conditions and are not part of the
Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB.

In some cases an MVTB wrapper function is required and these are included
within the contrib directory and implicitly have licences compatible with 
the software package that they wrap.

EPnP

VLFeat

SURF
==========================================================

1. Use the matlab based OpenSURF from 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28300-opensurf-including-image-warp

See @SurfPointFeature/private, it needs to be patched, see the .patch files.

2. Use the OpenCV based SURF implementation from
http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/petter/surfmex.php

See @SurfPointFeature/SURFmex-v2

If you place the MEX file OpenSurf.mexXYZ into @SurfPointFeatures you
get a signicant increase in performance, but also slightly different
results.  This package has the potential to use the GPU but I haven't
gotten this going yet.

Graphseg
==========================================================

graphseg.cpp is the MATLAB callable wrapper around the graph-segmentation 
code by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher
